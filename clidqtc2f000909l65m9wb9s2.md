Are you tired of waiting for your website to load faster, only to see potential customers click away?

You've poured your heart and soul into your website, and you want it to be lightning-fast, leaving your competitors in the dust.

But those sluggish load times are like an anchor weighing down your success.

Each second that goes by in page load time reduces the chance that a visitor will remain on your website, and perhaps be gone forever! But fear not, my friend. I'm here to introduce you to a game-changer: **image optimization**.

Images are often the biggest culprits behind sluggish website load times. They account for a **significant portion of web file sizes**, causing your pages to drag their feet when loading. Images can easily comprise up to 65% or more of a webpage's total size!

These longer load times not only hurt your chances of making visitors stay on your website but also hurt your **search engine optimization** (also known as **SEO**), which is your website ranking on search engines.

Reducing file size and reducing the number of requests to your web files increases the **available bandwidth** and **available free storage space** on your website.

These tips are specified for images, although they can apply to videos too. After all, videos are also a collection of images.

By employing a few nifty tricks and techniques, you can reduce the file sizes of your images without sacrificing quality, and watch your website speed soar.

Let's dive in!

## Tip 1: Embrace the Power of Compression

### What is Image Compression?

Image compression is the process of reducing the file size of an image without significantly compromising its visual quality. It aims to strike a balance between maintaining image clarity and reducing the amount of data needed to store or transmit the image.

There are two types of image compression: lossless compression and lossy compression.

1. **Lossless Compression**: This method reduces file size without sacrificing image quality.
    
2. **Lossy Compression**: This method achieves higher levels of compression by discarding some image data that is considered less important or visually imperceptible. By removing this data, the file size is significantly reduced, but it results in a slight loss of image quality.
    

Both lossless and lossy compression techniques play a vital role in image optimization. The choice between them depends on your use of the image.

For example, you may want to use lossless compression on your logo to avoid changing the brand colors. On the other hand, you can use lossy compression for generic filler images.

### How to compress images?

Ready to put compression into action? Let's get down to business. Here's a step-by-step guide to compressing your images and shedding those extra kilobytes:

1. Start by assessing your current image library and identifying the images that need optimization.
    
2. Choose a reliable image compression tool or plugin that suits your needs. Popular options include TinyPNG and JPEGmini. There are many more options out there, with different algorithms and for different file extensions.
    
3. Make a backup of your original images, just in case.
    
4. Use the compression tool to process your images. Experiment with different settings to find the balance between file size reduction and visual quality.
    
5. Replace the uncompressed images on your website with the compressed versions.
    
6. Voila! Your images are now lean and mean, ready to load at lightning speed.
    

But we're not done yet! There's more to making a blazing-fast site.

## Tip 2: Discover the Brilliance of Lazy Loading

### What is Lazy Loading?

Lazy loading is like a secret ninja technique for website optimization. It's all about loading images only when they're needed, rather than all at once. Imagine having to buy all your annual groceries at once. Doesnâ€™t make sense, right?

Lazy loading works in a similar way, delivering a seamless user experience by loading images as the user scrolls down the page. This reduces the initial load time and makes your website feel lightning-fast.

Lazy loading not only improves your website's loading speed but also has some nifty hidden advantages. One of them is reduced bandwidth usage. Think about it: why load images that your visitors might never see? Lazy loading ensures that only the images in the visible portion of the page are loaded, saving precious bandwidth and making your website more efficient. It's like serving only the dishes your guests are actually going to eat, minimizing waste and maximizing satisfaction.

### How to Implement Lazy Loading?

Ready to unleash the brilliance of lazy loading? Let's dive into the implementation process. Follow these steps, and your website will shine:

1. Identify the images that will benefit most from lazy loading, typically those below the fold or images in image-heavy sections.
    
2. Choose a lazy loading library or plugin that suits your website's platform. Popular options include **LazyLoad**, **Unveil.js**, and **Lozad.js**. Sometimes the site may already have an **option for lazy loading**, so do try to find it.
    
3. Install and activate the chosen library or plugin on your website.
    
4. Configure the settings to ensure that images are loaded progressively as the user scrolls. There may be different levels of lazy loading, so choose what most suits your website.
    
5. Test your website to make sure the lazy loading feature is working smoothly.
    

## Tip 3: Choose Your Image File Format Wisely

You may already know this: Jpeg (or jpg) image files are smaller than PNG. Both file formats are staples in the media and web design industry. Jpeg is favored for smaller file sizes. PNG is preferred for quality and transparency (Jpeg does not support transparency).

But there are new file formats on the web development scene.

### Say Hi to the WebP File Format.

Designed by Google in September 2010, **WebP** is a modern image format that brings significant advantages over traditional formats like JPEG and PNG.

WebP uses advanced compression techniques to achieve smaller file sizes while maintaining excellent image quality. This means faster load times without sacrificing visual appeal. All that whilst still being able to be a transparent image and supporting both lossy and lossless compression styles.

### Other File Formats

There are other file formats, some of which perform better than Webp, but are not as popular.

A good example is **AVIF** file format. It creates an even smaller file size, yet retains a much higher quality. Another reason why AVIF file is not yet as popular is that it uses more energy and CPU power to decode.

Another file format to look into is **SVG**. It stands for **Scalable Vector Graphics**. It does what it sounds like. Vector images that do not lose quality when enlarged. Their benefits can outweigh the downsides if the image does not have too much detail. Another downside to note is website security. Due to the nature of the file, it can introduce vulnerabilities to the site. Also, they are not fully compatible with older browsers, and can still be a struggle to set up on a website.

### Limitations of WebP files

* One limitation of using WebP images is limited browser support. While WebP offers significant benefits in terms of file size reduction and image quality, not all web browsers support this image format natively. As a result, some users may not be able to view WebP images properly on their browsers, which can impact the overall user experience. However, there are [fallback options](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71719254/correct-way-to-display-an-img-fallback) available, such as serving alternative image formats like JPEG or PNG for unsupported browsers, to ensure that all users can still access and view the images on your website.
    
* Another limitation of using WebP images is the potential for image quality loss. While WebP generally provides good image quality, aggressive compression settings or improper handling can result in noticeable artifacts or loss of detail in the image. It's important to strike the right balance between file size reduction and maintaining acceptable image quality when compressing images to WebP format.
    
* Additionally, it's worth noting that in some cases, despite using WebP compression, the resulting file size may be larger than expected. This can happen when the original image is already highly optimized or when the compression settings are not adjusted optimally. Google has an article about this [here](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/faq#can_a_webp_image_grow_larger_than_its_source_image). In such cases, additional tweaks to the compression settings or experimenting with different quality levels may be necessary to achieve the desired smaller file size without sacrificing too much image quality.
    
* Sometimes WebP files can use higher CPU power, which could affect the performance on a low-end server. So it's important to know your website hosting specs (and its strengths and weaknesses).
    

It's crucial to carefully test and review the image quality, image formats, and file size trade-offs when using WebP compression to ensure the best possible outcome for your specific images and use cases.

### How to convert images formats

1. Check if your website platform supports the chosen format. Many popular platforms like WordPress, Shopify, and Magento have **plugins or built-in features for WebP or file conversion support**.
    
2. Identify the images you want to convert. Start with the largest and most frequently viewed images for maximum impact.
    
3. Use an image converter tool like [Squoosh.app](https://Squoosh.app) or online services like Cloudinary to convert your images.
    
4. Replace the original images on your website with the new converted versions. Don't forget to update any image references in your HTML or CSS files.
    
5. Test your website thoroughly to ensure that the new images are loading correctly and delivering the expected boost in performance.
    

## Tip 4: Harness the Power of Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)

### What are CDNs?

CDNs are a network of servers strategically placed around the world, working together to deliver content quickly and efficiently. They deliver content from the servers that are closest (or that are the quickest to deliver) to the user.

By hosting your images on these distributed servers, CDNs minimize latency and reduce the distance data needs to travel, resulting in faster image delivery and improved website performance. It's like having a fleet of super-fast couriers at your disposal, delivering your images with lightning speed.

### Where to find a CDN?

Now, while you may be familiar with well-known CDNs (like CloudFlare), there are other lesser-known options that bring a wealth of benefits. These alternative CDNs come equipped with specialized features tailored toward image optimization. You can find these on a Google search or as a setting (or recommendation) on your web hosting.

Some CMS (content management systems) have their own CDNs or offer excellent plugins that seamlessly handle image optimization. By leveraging these lesser-known CDNs or CMS plugins, you can still take your image optimization strategies to the next level.

### How to Use a CDN?

1. Research and choose a CDN that aligns with your website's needs and budget.
    
2. Sign up for a CDN account and configure it according to your requirements.
    
3. Upload your images to the CDN's storage or connect your existing image library.
    
4. Configure the CDN settings to optimize image delivery, such as resizing for mobile devices and compression.
    
5. Integrate the CDN with your website by updating the necessary DNS settings or using plugins or extensions provided by the CDN.
    
6. Test your website thoroughly to ensure that the CDN is delivering optimized images and improving performance.
    

These solutions can also offer features like automatic resizing, compression, and support for lazy loading, allowing you to effortlessly enhance your website's speed and user experience.

CDNs can also implement image caching. You can read about caching in tip 5.

## Tips 5: Caching Images for Enhanced Website Performance

### What is Caching?

Caching involves **temporarily storing copies of files** on the user's device or in intermediary servers, allowing subsequent requests for the same files to be served faster.

By implementing image caching (or caching in general), the website does not have to send the same files again and again. Instead, it can just serve them what is already stored on their device or nearest server. This reduces the requests made to the website, which speeds up the website's loading speed.

To implement image caching effectively, you can leverage caching headers, such as the **"Cache-Control"** and **"Expires headers"** (header refers to an HTTP protocol), to define the caching behavior for specific images.

Cache-Control refers to how you chose to set your cache setting on the user or server side.

Expire headers refer to how long the cache remains in place, after which the cache becomes **"stale"**. The period for the cache settings to expire should depend upon certain factors such as your type of website and how often the content changes on your website.

**Cache refreshing** refers to removing the cache of a file, which forces a new fresh cache of the file. This is important when you have changed an image and want the new image to be live, instead of waiting for the cache to expire.

### Types of Cache

There are different types of cache, but it's important to implement the types that give you the most usefulness and flexibility.

To keep it simple, these types range from being on the side of the user (for example **"user/client-side caching"** or **"browser caching"**) to being on the website server (**"server-side caching"**) and everything in between like **CDN caching**.

These caching types can have further types. Some types of caching can act as both user and server-side cache.

### Which Type of Cache to Use?

Like many things in life, the answer is: it depends.

If your website gets a lot of requests for the same thing from different users, then it's best to use a server-side cache.

On the other hand, if a client requests the same file multiple times, then it makes sense to use a client-side cache.

Sometimes you may need to use both. It's best to evaluate your website based on different factors. These factors include the type of image.

The best solution can be found by testing your website speed yourself, whilst also tracking your website bounce rates. That way you can choose the best strategy for caching your images based on your insights and also identify any sort of cache problems that may occur.

### How to use image caching

Before implementing these settings, remember that these settings can sometimes be easily found on your web hosting platform or your website settings. Try to use these settings before using additional apps or codes.

* Utilize CDNs cache settings: Leverage the caching capabilities provided by your chosen CDN. Configure the cache settings to optimize the delivery of your images and reduce load times.
    
* Explore server-side caching: Investigate server-side caching options to further enhance performance. This type of caching stores frequently accessed images directly on your server, allowing for quick retrieval and delivery to users. Also, explore **server-side caching applications** that are suitable for non-experts. These apps can offer efficient caching solutions while minimizing the need for advanced technical knowledge.
    
* Consider user caching: Enable user caching, which involves storing images on a user's device after the initial visit. This allows subsequent visits to load images from the user's cache, reducing the need for re-downloading and improving overall speed.
    
* Evaluate plugins and libraries: Look for plugins or libraries that handle caching for your web files. These tools can simplify the implementation process and provide effective caching solutions. Choose one that aligns with your expertise or desired performance level.
    

## Tip 6: Optimize Image Dimensions

When it comes to images, the right size is important. Incorrectly sized images can slow down your website and lead to a subpar user experience.

This goes both ways. Images that are too large can significantly slow down a website. On the other hand, images that are too small can reduce the quality and experience of the user, especially if they are on a larger screen.

Another thing to consider is what type of screen the user is using. These factors include screen size (smaller such as mobiles and larger like large monitors) and screen aspect ratio (mobiles are generally longer whilst larger displays usually are wider).

### Here are some steps to optimize your web image dimensions:

1. Consider cropping your images if the cropped part is not important. This can help reduce the file size in most cases. A little goes a long way. You donâ€™t want to crop too much as it can cause pixelation issues. You may also want to consider the uniformity of images and ensure the aspect ratio stays the same.
    
2. Check your website and CDN settings for resizing images. You may be able to show different images to different users (based on the device type or browser for example)
    
3. Check the website user experience and speed to ensure you have the best image settings and web speed possible as well as the appropriate image quality.
